    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Medical student volunteers are matched to a project through a system that takes both the student's ranked
      requests and the community partner's needs into account. Volunteers can expect to be matched with a single
      community partner at a time. There is the opportunity to fulfill many individual requests, like childcare or
      errands, on an ongoing basis.</p>

            <h1>Description:</h1>
            <p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has allowed the use of non-medical face masks for the general public,
              especially in settings where social distancing can be difficult (eg. Grocery stores, public transit). To
              alleviate public demand for medical masks, this initiative aims to create and distribute home-made cloth face
              masks to vulnerable populations, who have additional socio-economic barriers preventing social distancing.
              There is also demand for face masks for non-medical support workers for these populations. We are currently
              working with local tailors/seamstresses, and have reached out to organizations who can donate fabric and
              materials.</p>

            <p>We are looking for enthusiastic students to fill several key leadership roles:</p>

              <li>Communications Director (2 positions): advertise donation and distribution efforts</li>
              <li>Sponsorship Director (2 positions): obtain funding  and donations for mask-building materials</li>
              <li>PPE Production Director (1 position): coordinate with tailors/seamstresses/volunteers to produce face masks</li>
              <li>PPE Distribution Director (1 position): coordinate distribution of face masks to public</li>
              <li>We are also taking student volunteers interested in sewing and putting together masks!</li>

            <p>Preference will be given to students with previous leadership, and public health experience. Experience working with vulnerable populations experience is an asset.</p>
