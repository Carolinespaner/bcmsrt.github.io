    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Medical student volunteers are matched to a project through a system that takes both the student's ranked requests and the community partner's needs into account. Volunteers can expect to be matched with a single community partner at a time. There is the opportunity to fulfill many individual requests, like childcare or errands, on an ongoing basis.</p>
