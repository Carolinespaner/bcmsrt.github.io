<p style="font-style: italic;">Kathy has requested the below statement published under her first name only, as she would prefer to maintain anonymity.</p>

<p>811 is a 24/7 phone service in BC staffed by navigators and health care professionals for
  answering all sorts of health-related questions. Since the outbreak, 811 has specifically opened
  a sub-service for all COVID-19 related questions. Medical students were recruited to answer the
  calls that are directed for the COVID-19 line. We work around clock depending on the needs of
  the public and the call center. Since working at 811, I have not only learned how to answer the
  FAQs regarding COVID-19, but also realized the aggravating impact that COVID-19 has on so
  many peopleâ€™s mental health, especially those with underlying mood disorders. Because of that
  and the limitation of being only a phone service, I learned to sharpen my listening and
  counselling skills, and become better at validating those worries as well as feelings.</p>

  <p>I believe these are valuable skills which I'll carry with me to and through residency. Lastly, I just want to acknowledge that this was not an easy job, and doing this has made me really appreciate all the amazing work that 811 helpers do 24/7!</p>
